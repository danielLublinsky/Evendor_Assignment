# Evendor_Assignment
 Evendor Assignment REPO

### HOW TO RUN:
+ First we need to install all the packets run in `./Evendor_Assignment`:
`npm install`
+ As well as in the react repo `./Evendor_Assignment/evendor_reactNative`:
`npm install`
+ Check your ip by typing `ipconfig` and save it for later

+ Then run the server from `./Evendor_Assignment`: `node server.js`

+ Then got to `./Evendor_Assignment/evendor_reactNative/App.tsx` scroll to the bottom and you will find this line: `export const SERVER_ADDRESS = 'http://192.168.1.7:3000';`
change the address to the address from the `ipconfig`

+ And if you have React Native installed on your machine, you can open a new CMD at `./Evendor_Assignment/evendor_reactNative` type: `npm run android`, enjoy :)

### A little about the app
This app showcases my skills in creating a backend service with essential GET/POST functions, along with demonstrating my ability to develop a good looking and dynamic React Native app. Additionally, it includes a brief demonstration of SQL querying and table relations.
